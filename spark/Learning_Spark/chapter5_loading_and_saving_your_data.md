+  textFile  
load one single file or all files from one directory into a rdd 

+   wholeTextFiles  
load files from one directory into a pair rdd

+   saveAsTextFile  
takes a path and will output the contents of the RDD to that file. The path is
treated as a directory and Spark will output multiple files underneath that
directory. This allows Spark to write the output from multiple nodes. With this
method we donâ€™t get to control which files end up with which segments of our
data, but there are other output formats that do allow this.

### Structured Data with Spark SQL  
+   Apache Hive with SQL   
+   JSON with SQL  

### Databases
