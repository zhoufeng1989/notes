浮点数精度的问题。

>>
       When you have a base 10 system (like ours), it can only express fractions
    that use a prime factor of the base. The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5. So
    1/2, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, and 1/10 can all be expressed cleanly because the
    denominators all use prime factors of 10. In contrast, 1/3, 1/6, and 1/7 are all
    repeating decimals because their denominators use a prime factor of 3 or 7. In
    binary (or base 2), the only prime factor is 2. So you can only express
    fractions cleanly which only contain 2 as a prime factor. In binary, 1/2, 1/4,
    1/8 would all be expressed cleanly as decimals. While, 1/5 or 1/10 would be
    repeating decimals

    Math.random 返回的是0 到 1 的一个浮点数，而且是均匀分布；这篇文章探讨了如何定制Random，使返回数值的分布不均匀分布。
